Changes from 2.0.5
2012-03-23
+ Improved portfolio management
  + Improved metrics in Story, Iteration and Project widgets used to create custom views into the 
    development portfolio
+ Improved support for product and release planning
  + Drag & drop multiple stories in the story tree view with a single operation
  + Project burn-up now displays an additional graph based on the maximum of story points in the 
    tree (e.g. story of 10 points having two children with 2 points each => 10 points, instead of 4)
  + New story attribute 'Value' (a non-negative integer, similar to story points)
  + An entire story hierarchy (including tasks) can now be marked as Done on a single action
  + Added 'rank to top' and 'rank to bottom' as separate buttons in the 
    project leaf stories view for faster ranking; fixed bug regarding these actions
  + Improved layout when creating stories in the project leaf stories list
  + New stories are now created to the top of the project leaf stories list
  + Story IDs are displayed in the project leaf story list for easier reference
+ Improved iteration management
  + New state 'Deferred' for stories and tasks to indicate that it has been scoped out of the
    project or iteration. Deferred stories (tasks) are ignored in all metrics
  + Stories (including tasks) can now be copied in iteration view - helps e.g. in
    dealing with unfinished stories at the end of an iteration
  + Iteration burndown now depicts cumulative spent effort as a function of time (when timesheets are enabled)
  + Setting tasks as 'Ready' prompts for zeroing of effort left
  + Iteration history tab now includes trace of added/removed stories
  + Story IDs are displayed in the iteration story list for easier reference
+ User rights
  + Teams can now be deleted (preparatory work for the upcoming teams/products access matrix)
+ Support for Agilefant's research-industry ecosystem
  + Manual export of database for research and/or backup purposes (outputs a zipped SQL dump that you 
    can email - Agilefant does not send anything anywhere!)
  + Automatic anonymization of an exported database for research purposes (all object names 
    are replaced with their ID's, all text fields in objects are replaced with string length) 
+ Usability improvements
  + All editing is now done with single-click (instead of double-click); double-click still works, though
  + Improved look & feel of story tree drag n' drop
  + Smoother drag n' drop for ranking stories in story lists
  + Search now includes tasks as well
  + Focus to main frame when loading all pages (pages can be scrolled without unnecessary 
    focus clicking when not using a mouse)
  + Planned size of projects and iterations now explicitly as man-hours
+ Misc small bug fixes

=================================================================

Compared to the previous major version, Agilefant 1.6, the 2.0 version has the
following changes.

For more information and questions, visit http://www.agilefant.org/.

- Totally renewed user interface
 * The interface has been streamlined and works similarly in every view
 * Performance and ease-of-use is now on a totally different level

- Conceptual model has been fundamentally changed
 * Instead of a workaround on iteration level, the stories are now consistent
   throughout the whole system
 * The former tags have been changed to a more intuitive and easy-to-use labeling
   system
 * A work queue for tasks has been added to the Daily Work page
  
- Hierarchical backlog management
 * Product level backlog has been replaced with a story tree
 * Project backlog is now a collection of all of its iterations' stories
 * Hierarchy is allowed on project and product levels. Iteration stories can't
   have children

- Disabling unneeded views
 * The Timesheets, Daily Work, and Portfolio views can be disabled through the
   Settings page. 

- Browser support:
 * Firefox 3.0+ and Google Chrome are officially supported
 * Safari should work fine
 * IE8 is not guaranteed to work, but works to some standard
 * Opera probably works to some extent, but has not been tested
