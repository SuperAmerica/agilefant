Agilefant 2.0.1
Release notes
2010-06-28
--


Compared to the previous major version, Agilefant 1.6, the new version has the
following changes.

For more information and questions, visit http://www.agilefant.org/.

- Totally renewed user interface
 * The interface has been streamlined and works similarly in every view
 * Performance and ease-of-use is now on a totally different level

- Conceptual model has been fundamentally changed
 * Instead of a workaround on iteration level, the stories are now consistent
   throughout the whole system
 * The former tags have been changed to a more intuitive and easy-to-use labeling
   system
 * A work queue for tasks has been added to the Daily Work page
  
- Hierarchical backlog management
 * Product level backlog has been replaced with a story tree
 * Project backlog is now a collection of all of its iterations' stories
 * Hierarchy is allowed on project and product levels. Iteration stories can't
   have children

- Disabling unneeded views
 * The Timesheets, Daily Work, and Portfolio views can be disabled through the
   Settings page. 

- Browser support:
 * Firefox 3.0+ and Google Chrome are officially supported
 * Safari should work fine
 * IE8 is not guaranteed to work, but works to some standard
 * Opera probably works to some extent, but has not been tested
