    <th colspan="2">Leaf stories</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="dontWrap">Done count</td>
    <td>The sum of the all done leaf stories' story points inside the current story. Leaf stories are stories that do not have children.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="dontWrap">Total count</td>
    <td>The sum of all leaf stories' story points</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Estimated progress</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      Estimated progress is calculated for each story in the branch and their
      children recursively. The story's own story point estimate is compared
      to the sum of its children story points. The greater number will be included
      in the estimate.
